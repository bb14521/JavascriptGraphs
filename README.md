# Interactive Graph
I created  Interactive  graphs using javascript and Amchart library.
Interactive graphs show data points at particular points whenever the user moves the mouse pointer.

Requirements:
-----------------------------
     1) Download Amchart library http://www.amcharts.com/download/.
     2) Add link of .js library in your  html file. 
     
To see output go to link:http://manpreet9112.github.io/JavascriptGraphs/curvedemo.html   
    
OR
--------------------------
Clone this repository https://github.com/manpreet9112/JavascriptGraphs and
run its html file in browser.
